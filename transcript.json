  "text": "Okay, so this is our field, our form on our website. So we have it embedded on our page. You can see the address up there, but you can send it to directly with the link Becky as we were talking about. But anyway, so this is all the fields are mandatory. It's got the star by them. We do date of tour. You guys could have maybe a option to title it whatever tour you have, you know, the Corvette Car Club or the St. Anne's Church group or whatever or just the date. Anyway, and then you've got the information they have to put in. Of course they can put anything in, but usually they do it accurately. The date of birth, you can do it. We have some conditions, so it double checks and makes sure that they've got the right date in there. It can't be in advance. And so if I put in 2020 the birth date comes up and it says you're five years old. So as long as they check the minor because they're five years old you can submit it. But if they're not a minor, if they're a Florida resident, the submit button is not there. so they have to be older than 18. Florida resident comes up, we need driver's license, that's it. And then if you're not a Florida resident, that's when we have to do the social security number. So as long as they give you the information. Oh, and then we send an email. It just says, congratulations, you put in your submission, but if they want to, then they have to put in an email address so they can get that. They don't have to. Either way, when you hit the submit, it'll come up and your submission's been received. You can return to the page or you can enter information for another person. If you do that, it just clears all the fields and you start all over again. That's how we do it on the customer's end. Now, when you go to JotForm, JotForm, these are all the forms we have, but we'll just go to our submissions. I've shortened this page so it doesn't show any of the PII that I have, so it's narrow. And this is all our submissions. Now we can filter it. Normally what we do is date of tour. So if we have date of tour, then we can apply that filter and that's just the date of tour. If we're looking for one particular person, because sometimes people put the wrong name in. Let's see, we got Keaton, we can do that and then it comes up with whatever we're searching for. So it's pretty useful in that instance. But let's do this, do date of tour, and now that we have all these entries, I have 20 entries and I go over here and I can download it as Excel. All right, and so that's mine. When it downloads, I actually have to change the name of the file because when I merge the documents with Microsoft Word, it's looking for a particular file. So I'll show you that. has to have the same name. So when you get it downloaded on your computer, whatever name you're calling your file, this is what I happen to call mine, then you just need to make sure that you change the name to it because the merge document is looking for that file in that particular folder. So Microsoft Word. So now you've got your Word document here and In Word, you go to Mailings. In Mailings, what you will do is you'll select recipients. Let's see. I'll give you this document. It's the same, I assume it's the same document that you guys have. So it's kind of already filled in. These names are part of my JotForm name. So when you open that Excel spreadsheet, let me you've got the information. So, you know, whatever you've labeled your columns, that's the information you're going to use in this mail merge. So let's get rid of this. So when you start your mail merge, you can step-by-step mail word wizard, which would be helpful, I'll certainly if you want. But the recipient, you're going to use an existing list, mail merge list, you're going to select the document and it'll be the same document every time you open it. So when you use the existing list, you're going to go to that Where's my balance? That Excel spreadsheet that we renamed so it would have the same name every time and you're going to use that. And it'll come up as Sheet 1 and it'll be saved in the merge document. So when you open the merge document it'll tell you, hey, we're going to use records from this file on this sheet. do that. Let me just close this so you can see what happens. So if I open up Word, here we go. Right here, my tour merge, that's what I've called my tour merge document. When I open it up, it says, opening this document will run the following command and it's going to select from sheet one, the data and I've already told it the file name, which is the same every time I do it. So yes. And then when you go to mailings, you can preview results right here. So let me just shift you over so I don't have I don't want to put this in the video. But you can see once I preview results, that's what I clicked, all of the information from those tours came in. And as you see when I was doing it earlier and I was showing you how to do the JotForm, there's my mess-ups that I was putting in. during that. So I'm going to unpreview it and I'll bring it back in here. So that right up here is the preview results and that shows you the actual results. So this form the way you do it is you insert a merge field and when you click on this, there you go, it tells you it gives you a list of all the fields that you have in your Excel spreadsheet. so that's all I've done. We've got first, middle, last, birth date, driver's license, state, social security number. So that's how you do it. You just fill out that first form that way. And then the next line is exactly the same thing. So you can cut and paste it, but you have to start with next record. So it'll give you the next record, and that is over here. in rules. So if you go up here to rules, your next record is right there. And I mean I can show you how simple it is. So I have 20. So all 20 of these take up two pages to do. But it's real simple because once you have your table, let's see. I'll just show you this right here. If you tab, you create the next line. and you just cut and paste this there. So now I have 21 records and then you would just do that however many times you need it. You could just duplicate however many you need. So it's pretty easy once you get it in. So I'm gonna delete this line. Delete that row. So the 20 takes up this many pages but when you preview it again, get this out of the way. Those 20 names only take up this much space. Now once you have your, once you have it all ready to go, you come over here to finish and merge and finish and merge you're going to edit an individual document. When you do that, it's going to create a new document. So this merge document, you never save this. You just use it every time. So I'm going to again go over here so you can't see the information. And I finish, I'm going to edit the individual document. Let me pause this. Okay, so actually I can show you. So if you had the preview results all the names would be here and you would be able to see them but it doesn't matter. What you're going to do is you're going to go to finish and merge up here and I don't know if you can see that edit individual document. Let's see if I can pull it over here and let you see that a little better. Edit individual document right here and so when you do that it creates a new document. You're going to use all the records of course, and then it will create your new document. Let me do that. So you can see again, I've shortened it so that you can't see all that information on this video. But you have this new document and the document name is I'm just going to go in here, do it this way. All right, so I just deleted all this information so I didn't have to worry about it in the video. So now you've got this new document called letter2 in Word. and I have my fields highlighted so that I remember to change them because this, what is this? This is 0214 2025. We are, we actually have two tours that day, so we have one at nine o'clock and we have one at 10 o'clock. And then number of guests we have is 20. and we are going to have two buses. So I don't know what your caravan thing does, but that at least alerts me with those highlighted fields that I need to change that. Everything else is the same. I don't have to change anything else because the merge document already has that in there. So then I just do a save as and I name this document the same thing every time so that it just copies over on top of the last word document. So that I save it. So I only ever have one document that has this PII information in it. Oh wait. I skipped a step. Oops. Go back. Sorry. Before I save this document, the key is you have to password protect it. So I go into info, protect document, encrypt with password. So this is the same password I use every time. Same password and the badging office has this password so they can open it. So, I'm going to delete this so it doesn't really matter. And it's going to ask you to do it twice. All right, and now that you've protected it, now you can do your save. But you're going to do a save as because, well, that's how I do it. I save it as the same document every time, just like I mentioned. So I'm going to put it down here. That's the name of the document I send every time I send it. We go. Replace existing file, yes. All right. And so there it is. So now that is the end of what I do in Word. I'm going to close this document and then I'm going to close this merge document, which is going to ask me, do I want to save changes? No, I do not. because this merge document is going to be the same all the time. That never changes. So that's the end of that. When I go to send the email, let's see. All right, so I go to send my email. I do a new email to, you know, whoever I'm going to send it to. I'll send it to Becky. I'll, we have a standard email that we just click it in into, but right here you go and you find the folder wherever it is. And I just want to show you this because it's already password protected. Okay, so there it is right there. So, and then in my email that I send it says, Please find attached IAL 4214-25 TOR. Basically what it says. But now if you try to open this document, you're going to have to have the password, right? There you have it, otherwise it won't open. Then you just send it that way now that it's password protected. And I think that's it. I don't know what else I can tell you. I'm sure there'll be questions. The mail merge is something you can find tutorials online, but I can, matter of fact, I'll just send you the merge document I have. Good luck.",
