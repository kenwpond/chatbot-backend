  "text": "All right, so we're going to add new activities. We're on the calendar all the way through October, so we're going to start with November 1st and we're going to add the activities. Before we add any activities, we want to go to the Lighthouse Tour page and we want to scroll all the way to the end and look at November to see if we have any conflicts. So none of these are conflicts except for Thanksgiving. so on Thursday the 28th. So when we want to come in here and we want to go to Thursday the 28th, which I need one more week. And, oh, I've already blocked it out. So. And it's not the 28th, it's the 27th. So Thanksgiving, I blocked it out. No, tours to the lighthouse. Now, it doesn't mean you can't have a wildlife tour, but. Usually, Thursdays is not a day for that. So that's blocked out. We're going to go back to November 1st and we're going to new availability right here. I'm going to click on that. We're going to add the four-hour tour. Starts at 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. and we are going to repeat weekly. oh, why? No, I haven't done that yet. Okay, so this is important. I've done this before and messed up the whole calendar. So pick your start date, which is Saturday the 1st, and we're going to do it weekly. And it is going to be on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. And we're going to end date. and Liz, this is, is up to you. You can put it on the calendar so it never ends. It's always there. I have limited mine to six months out just because people pay for the tour, and I would rather not have all of that if somebody decides they want to do a tour 18 months from now, I don't have to worry about that. You can do whatever you want with that information. So we're going to go ahead and do it through the 31st, which is Wednesday, so that doesn't matter. Let's just do it through the 27th. Okay, so we're going to do it through the 27th and we'll have to come back and check those dates. based on the eligibility of the lighthouse, which we will have some cancellations. Actually, you know what? Yep, let's just do it this way. Okay, so we're going to save that. I'm going to go to calendar and now you can see they're already here. So I already had a lighthouse and hangar sea excursion on this day. Somebody's requested that ahead of time. So I put it on the calendar. I don't know why it says 00 spots. Oh, probably because I need to edit the time slot and add a resource for that. Okay. I don't know why it wasn't already there. So now on this date, we have our 9:00 regular tour and then we have the 10:15 hanger seat. And that's because these people, the Randalls, requested that and we put it on the calendar. When did they book it? Be interesting to see how long ago. On May 16th, so they requested on May 16th for that November tour. So we added it. Okay, so we added now, I don't know why, I don't have these in October. So what we want to do is we just want to add Fridays. October 31st is Halloween and they do do tours on Halloween. And we have actually dressed up and done some fun stuff for that tour in the in years past. So have fun with that. All right. So again, I'm leaving Thursdays open. I don't know if I left them open in October. Yeah, I left them all in September and October. I just left Thursdays open. So as you get closer and as they start to book out, you can always add that Thursday tour. November we'll have enough people to do all the days, so I'm going to go ahead and leave that on. Now that's those four hour tours. We'll add the Wednesday tour. Sorry, let's go back up here. New availability. The three hour 9 to 12. starts on November 5th, repeats weekly on Wednesdays until And then we'll have to fix some of that. Why? Where did it go? Where did it go? There it is. Okay. And then we add the two-hour tour. And that one's going to start at 11:21. this weekly, Wednesdays till the seventh. Okay, now we have to go in and change a couple of things. So the third Oh, okay, I have to fix that. I don't know why the Lighthouse and Hangar C is not showing up. I'm gonna have to do that to every one of them. Let me go to Products, Activities, this should have a resource. each resource. I don't know why the resource isn't coming up. Okay, so I figured it out. The Lighthouse and Hangers Excursion, the edit time slot, the equipment under advanced setting didn't have the tour applied to all times. So, it's now applied to all times. So, you've got that double van because you don't want it to interfere with the 9 o'clock four hour tour. So, whenever you've got a two hour on the same day, you use that double van so that you're not conflicting with the 9:00 a.m. tour. So there you go. So that's taken care of. Now, the third week of the month, November 1-2-3, we cannot have the Missile Museum tour because that's when the newcomers tour happens. So we are going to edit this time slot, cancel it, Cancel this time only and we will add a two two-hour tours. But it's open house day and it doesn't open until 10, so we don't want to start a two-hour tour earlier. Let me see what time we've got. I forget. One, two, three. We start one at 10 and the other at 11. All right, it's just for informational purposes. So we've got one, two, three. So this one already starts at 11, so we're going to add a two hour. This starts at 9 ends No, no, it starts at 10. I can do math, I can. Ends at 12. Okay, on Wednesday, November 19th, then we're just doing that one doesn't repeat. Okay, so that's the third Wednesday of the month that we have the two hours instead of the three hours, okay? So we've added the tours. You can add some two hour tours in here. I will leave that up to you. We can do that a little bit tomorrow. We already have that one right there. And I did this through December. So now what we need to do is we need to go back to the Lighthouse page and find out. Okay, so the 26, I mean, not 26-6, 6789. So 6, 7, 8, and 9. So December 6th we will cancel this time slot and 7, 8, and 9 so we don't have any. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to add a tour. To this day, schedule availability, and I'm going to add the tour placeholder for tour date right here, and I'm going to repeat that daily until December, what I say 6, 7, 8, and 9. because now I'm going to go in here and I'm going to put a note at a time slot note. What was the note? Guardian area. I have to go. I'm just going to put that note in one of those days. Okay, now we'll go back because that was the 6th through the 9th. We also are not going to run tours 11th, 12th, 13th. 14th. Okay, so the 11th through the 14th. Oh, I already have that blocked out. So I'm going to leave it up to you, Liz. You can, if you want to run wildlife tours or do something else, you can remove these blocked out dates, but it's blocked out because of those tours. And there's no way to leave a note on that. I don't think it's going to let me. say to the 14th. What did I say? Yes to the 14th. Really? What's the point of blocking out the dates if it'll let you do that? Do you let me do it or not? No, it didn't let me do it. Okay, so you can remove the blocked out dates and you can add that placeholder for tour dates here if you want. I thought maybe I could get through the back door, but it won't let me. All right, what else is in December? We've got Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and then New Year's Eve and New Year's Day. So we will go to Christmas Eve and cancel that. Cancel that. Hit cancel. And, and then we can certainly go to first of January and do the same thing. this side would be 1215. Reversed and the first. Okay. All right. So, that's how you update it. so if you want to go in and add anything else, you just go up, you either click on the day so you can just, you know, like you want to add it to or during that day, you can just do it this way or at the top you can just click new availability and do it that way. That's how you do it and you're good through December except you can fill in those blank days as needed. As I mentioned, September and October, I left the Thursdays open. As you get other bookings, you can fill in those Thursdays. No wait lists at this point. That is definitely something that you can add later. Again, September and October are kind of slow, but See, August is kind of slow too. Let me see. I've got some wait lists. Got some wait lists in August, July 31st. So there's no reason can't just add wait lists to these days, Thursdays. Yeah, I don't even have Thursdays on August either. We're in July. So that was this week we just worked on. We've got wait lists here, wait lists here. Okay, so we'll just go ahead and add waitlist to August. No reason not to. Yeah, I think I just did it through July. It ends there. So let's go to new availability and add waitlist for our tour. to August repeats weekly. Just in that August. So now I do want to come in here. I'm going to remove it from this day because we've already got a second tour. So we can't have a wait list. So we moved it from there. No wait list for that day. I suppose, you know what, you could just leave these wait lists on the Thursdays. There's no reason not to. And then if you get some bookings, you can decide if somebody can't make it the other days. There you go. So no reason not to leave them on those days. You would maybe do the same thing for September. So in September, I have those Thursdays open. so you could always add wait lists on the Thursday and wait lists on these other days. But I'll let you do that after you watch the video. Hope it's clear as mud.",
